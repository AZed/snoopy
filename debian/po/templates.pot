#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"snoopy is a library that can only reliably do its work if it is mandatorily "
"preloaded via /etc/ld.so.preload. Since this can potentially do harm to the "
"system, your consent is needed. Should the snoopy library be put into /etc/"
"ld.so.preload?"
