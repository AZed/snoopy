This package was debianized by Aubin Paul <aubin@debian.org> on
Mon, 16 Apr 2001 16:21:24 -0400 and has been taken over by Marc Haber
<mh+debian-packages@zugschlus.de> in March 2002.

It was downloaded from http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/marius/snoopy/. The
source for snoopy 1.3 has vanished from that place, and the source
forge site this URL points to
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/snoopylogger/) has a .tar.gz with an
md5sum of 7f1bfc5c10f05cd127b414facc43cc5f which differs from the
.orig.tar.gz in the Debian archive. However, both archives have
identical contents verified with diff -urN on 2004-05-24.
