  Snoopy Logger ChangeLog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2014-11-07 - Version  2.0.1
---------------------------
o Bugfix: fixed uninitialized pointer in filter/exclude_uid.c and only_uid.c
o Enhancement: prefix all iniparser errors with "SNOOPY " prefix, so it is
    evident where errors are coming from
o Bugfix: changed --with-config-file to --enable-config-file. Having two ways
    to specify where configuration file exists is redundant and confusing.


2014-11-05 - Version  2.0.0
---------------------------
o Feature: Added support for custom message format specification at
    configuration time
o Feature: New input providers:
    - egroup       (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - env          (thanks Taylor Kimball)
    - eusername    (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - group        (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - login        (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - username     (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - tty_uid      (thanks Tony Malkowski)
    - tty_username
o Feature: Implemented internal filtering, with the following filters available:
    - exclude_uid
    - only_root
    - only_uid
o Feature: Added optional support for INI configuration file
o Feature: Added envp data to intputdatastorage if execve() is used. Prepared
    for future inputs to consume it.
o Feature: Created snoopy-enable and snoopy-disable system scripts.

o Distro packaging: added debian/ubuntu packaging data (by Sebastien Gross)
o Distro packaging: added rhel/centos package spec file (by Jeremy Brown)

o Refactoring: Separated data gathering into separate functions, to be
    used at will - now they are called "input providers"
o Refactoring: Removed external filtering, to be replaced with internal
    filtering capability in the making
o Refactoring: Removed logging exclusion via prefix, was created for
    exclusion of logging of external filter commands
o Refactoring: switched to autotools completely
o Refactoring: all builds now use -Wall and -Werror
o Refactoring: removed --enable-cwd-logging (superseded by message formatting
    options and input provider)
o Refactoring: snoopy library is now called libsnoopy.so instead of snoopy.so,
    to conform to autotools syntax
o Refactoring: ./configure: removed many bugs, added proper syntax and error
    messages to help user decide what she wants
o Refactoring: added 'proper' (unified) error handling
o Refactoring: moved input testing to separate executable, which does not get
    installed, but is only intended for development/debugging
o Refactoring: created proper initialization/shutdown methods

o Documentation: added into about writing new input providers
o Bugfix: fixed compilation failure on debian in inputs/cwd.c (thanks Sébastien Gross)
o Bugfix: missing snoopy.ini in distribution tarball (thanks Jeremy Brown)
o Bugfix: When uninstalling, also disable snoopy (remove from /etc/ld.so.preload).


2013-04-06 - Version  1.9.0
---------------------------

o Fixed 1-byte memory leak introduced in previous release


2010-09-24 - Version  1.7.2
---------------------------
o Logs current tty (initial patch provided by Aldemira user on SourceForge)


2010-02-11 - Version  1.6.1
---------------------------
o Logs current working directory


2010-02-09 - Version  1.6.0
---------------------------
o Uses autotools now

o Rewritten logging function to avoid memory leaks
o No more segfaults on 64bit platforms
o Program name and argument lengths limited to 4096 bytes
o Many thanks to otheus for supplying a patch on SourceForge one and a half 
    years ago, it helped tremendously.


2010-02-09 - Version  1.5.0
---------------------------
o Updated to compile and work without segfaults on 32bit and 64bit platforms
o Project maintenance taken over by Bostjan Skufca


Sun December 10 - Version  1.3
------------------------------
o Altered logging mechanism for performance
o Added new way of logging (can choose)
o Added an integrity check (optional)


Wed October 25 - Version  1.2a
-----------------------------
o ROOT_ONLY behavior now works again, thanks to adrian.head@bytecomm.com.au for
  notifying us!


Thu October 10 - Version  1.2
-----------------------------
o Fixed small bug with rather adverse side effects. 


Thu August 17 - Version  1.1
----------------------------
o Added support for execv().  Although execv() calls execve()
  [as described in the man page], execv() calls don't seem to log.
  They now do.  Will investigate this issue a bit further.
o Made logging code modular, as to accomodate for the extra 
  overload that execv() brought.


Thu August 3  - Version 1.00
----------------------------
o Cleaned up the codebase a bit
o Added the output of username and sid (PID of the login shell) 
  to the logged output
o Fixed install.sh to be compatible with older (v1.0) bash shells
