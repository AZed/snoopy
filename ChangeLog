Thu October 10 - Version  1.2
-----------------------------
o Fixed small bug with rather adverse side effects. 

Thu August 17 - Version  1.1
----------------------------
o Added support for execv().  Although execv() calls execve()
  [as described in the man page], execv() calls don't seem to log.
  They now do.  Will investigate this issue a bit further.
o Made logging code modular, as to accomodate for the extra 
  overload that execv() brought.

Thu August 3  - Version 1.00
----------------------------
o Cleaned up the codebase a bit
o Added the output of username and sid (PID of the login shell) 
  to the logged output
o Fixed install.sh to be compatible with older (v1.0) bash shells
