  Snoopy is designed to aid the taks of a sysadmin by providing a log of
  commands  executed. Snoopy is  completely transparent  to the user and
  applications it hooks in as a library providing a wrapper around calls
  to execve() calls. Logging is done via syslogd and written to authpriv
  allowing secure offsite logging of activity, generally the authpriv is
  stored as /var/log/auth.log.

U S A G E

  Snoopy is  able to log all  users or just root,  this functionality is
  configured at compile through the snoopy.h header, #define ROOT_ONLY 1
  will restrict logging to root activities. Installation is as follows: 

     make
     make install

  Snoopy is placed in /etc/ld.so.preload to trap all occurances of exec,
  if you wish to monitor only certain applications you can do so through
  the $LD_PRELOAD environment variable - simply set it to /lib/snoopy.so
  before loading the application. For example:

     export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/snoopy.so
     lynx http://linux.com/
     unset LD_PRELOAD 

  To remove snoopy later, simply edit /etc/ld.so.preload and remove the
  reference to snoopy.so and delete /lib/snoopy.so.
